Case study:Perform text analytics using RHadoop on Harvard Business Review articles 
-To compute the distribution of articles by various levels of document type attribute
-To compute word frequencies from the text present in the Abstract attribute
-To analyse how the usage of words in article abstracts has been changing over the years.

Description:

The data set needed for this part would be Harvard business review articles file named HBR_Abstracts.txt which is a tab separated text file 
with 12,749 records and 9 variables. This data contains information about various articles published between 1922 and 2012 in Harvard business 
review. You can make use of either rmr2 package functions or plyrmr package functions wherever applicable for answering these questions.

1. Write a mapreduce program to compute the distribution of articles by various levels of document_type attribute? Also, find out average length 
of article for each of the category present in document_type attribute?

2. Write a mapreduce program to compute word frequencies from the text present in the Abstract attribute? Using the final output, plot a word 
cloud visualization showcasing the most frequent words being used in the Abstract text.

3. Write a mapreduce program to analyze how the usage of words in article abstracts has been changing over the years? For quantifying usage, 
please consider only the top 5 highly occurring words amongst the articles for a particular year. Please plot the final output representing 
the changing trend of words over the years.
