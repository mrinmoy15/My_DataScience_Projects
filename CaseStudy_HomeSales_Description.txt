Case Study: Exploratory Data Analysis using RHadoop.

Description:

Here a data set called Home_Sales.txt contains information on homes sold in San Francisco between 2/13/2008 and 7/14/2009. 
Using RHadoop tools EDA (data cleaning and data preparation) to be preformed. You have to make use of plyrmr package functions 
for answering these questions unless mentioned otherwise.

1. Write a mapreduce program to compute number of rows and columns present in the given dataset. 
Additionally, find out the distribution of homes present across different neighborhoods present in the dataset. 

2. Write a mapreduce program to compute quantile values of all the numeric variables present in the dataset like Price, 
Bedroom, Squarefeet and Lotsize. Looking at the quantile outputs, please provide comments on the present outlier values if any. 

3. Write a mapreduce program to identify the number of missing values present across all the variables in the dataset. 
Additionally, please perform a missing value treatment on the “neighbourhood” variable if you notice any missing values. 
For the missing value treatment, note that plyrmr package functions are not supported and you need to write a custom mapreduce program 
using rmr2 syntax.
